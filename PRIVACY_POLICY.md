### What We DO Collect

**Nothing**. This extension operates entirely locally on your device.

## Data Storage

### Data Persistence

- Data is automatically removed if you uninstall the extension
- You can clear extension data through your browser's settings at any time

## Network Requests

### Chrome Version Updates

The extension makes a single daily network request to maintain up-to-date Chrome version spoofing:

- **Endpoint**: `chrome-mask-remote-storage.0b101010.services/current-chrome-major-version.txt`
- **Purpose**: Fetch the current Chrome major version number
- **Frequency**: Once every 24 hours (configurable via browser alarms)
- **Data Sent**: No user data or identifiers are transmitted
- **Data Received**: Only a plain text Chrome version number (e.g., "131")
- **Security**: All requests use HTTPS encryption

### Request Details

- **Method**: GET request
- **Headers**: Standard browser headers only, no custom tracking headers
- **Response**: Plain text version number only
- **Logging**: The remote service does not log requests or IP addresses
- **Infrastructure**: Hosted on Cloudflare R2 with no server-side logic

## Third-Party Services

### Cloudflare R2

- **Purpose**: Hosts the Chrome version update file
- **Data Processing**: No user data is processed or stored
- **Privacy**: Subject to Cloudflare's privacy policy for infrastructure only
- **No Tracking**: No analytics, cookies, or tracking mechanisms

## Permissions Explained

The extension requires certain permissions to function:

- **Storage**: Save your site preferences locally
- **Tabs**: Access current tab URL to enable per-site functionality
- **Host Permissions (`<all_urls>`)**: Modify request headers on sites you choose to enable
- **Scripting**: Inject JavaScript to spoof browser properties
- **Alarms**: Schedule automatic Chrome version updates
- **Declarative Net Request**: Modify User-Agent headers in network requests

**Important**: These permissions are used solely for the extension's functionality and never for data collection.

## Data Security
