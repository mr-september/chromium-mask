🔧 Technical Improvements

- Unified Linux/Windows spoofing controls in popup and options page
- Improved localization for new spoofing features in all supported languages
- Updated UI styling for consistency and better dark/light mode support
- Enhanced toggle event handling and state refresh (no more full reloads)
- Improved error messages and input validation for site management

## 1.5.0 (Per-Site Linux Platform Control) - July 2025

**🚀 Major Feature: Per-Site Linux Platform Spoofing**

Added comprehensive per-site control for Linux users to choose which sites use Windows Chrome spoofing vs Linux Chrome spoofing, replacing the global all-or-nothing approach.

### 🌟 New Features

- **Per-Site Platform Lists**: Linux users can now manage which sites should use Windows spoofing on a site-by-site basis
- **Enhanced Options Page**: New "Linux Platform Settings" section with add/remove site functionality
- **Smart Platform Display**: Popup shows current site's platform identity ("Windows Chrome (spoofed)" vs "Linux Chrome (native)")
- **Visual Status Indicators**: Options page shows which sites have Chrome masking active vs waiting
- **Automatic Migration**: Users with global Linux Windows spoofing enabled get all sites automatically added to the per-site list

### 🎯 Use Case Benefits

- **Streaming Services**: Add Netflix/Hulu to Windows spoofing while keeping YouTube as Linux
- **Development Tools**: Keep GitHub/VS Code Web as Linux for better development experience
- **Banking/Enterprise**: Add banking sites to Windows spoofing while keeping AWS Console as Linux
- **Granular Control**: Choose optimal platform identity per site instead of global all-or-nothing

### 🛠️ Technical Architecture

- **`LinuxWindowsSpoofList`**: New class following established `EnabledHostnamesList` patterns
- **Per-hostname DNR rules**: Each site gets appropriate platform-specific headers dynamically
- **Smart reloading**: Only affected sites reload when platform settings change
- **Backward compatibility**: Legacy global setting still works but marked as deprecated
- **Code unification**: Reuses existing infrastructure and patterns for efficiency

### 📋 Migration & Compatibility

- **Seamless upgrade**: Existing users get identical behavior with new per-site control
- **Legacy support**: Global toggle remains functional but deprecated
- **Zero breaking changes**: All existing functionality preserved
- **Future-ready**: Foundation for additional platform-specific features

## 1.4.1 (Linux Toggle Fix) - July 2025

**🐧 Critical Linux Bug Fix**

Fixed a Linux-specific bug where the Chrome/Opera toggle in the popup would not stay activated, reverting to deactivated state immediately after clicking.

### 🔧 Bug Fixes

- **Fixed Linux Toggle Race Condition**: Resolved timing issues that caused the Linux platform toggle to revert after activation
- **Enhanced UI State Management**: Linux toggle now properly refreshes UI state after changes (consistent with main toggle)
- **Improved Storage Operations**: Added proper sequencing and logging for Linux spoof setting changes
- **Better Error Handling**: Enhanced error recovery and state reversion for failed toggle operations

### 🛠️ Technical Improvements

- Added comprehensive logging for Linux toggle operations
- Implemented small delay to ensure service worker completes processing before UI refresh
- Enhanced service worker message handling with better error responses
- Improved storage operation sequencing in ChromeUAStringManager

### 📋 Affected Platforms

## 1.4.0 (Smart Tab Reload Optimization) - July 2025

**🚀 Performance & User Experience Enhancement**

Implemented intelligent tab reload system that significantly reduces unnecessary tab refreshes while maintaining full spoofing functionality.

### ✨ Key Improvements

- **Smart Tab Reload**: Only reloads specific sites being toggled, not all masked sites
- **Immediate Spoofing Effect**: Sites being enabled get reloaded so spoofing takes effect instantly
- **Graceful Disabling**: Sites being disabled continue without disruption
- **Optimized Linux Spoof**: Platform changes apply to new requests without disrupting current tabs
- **Configurable Reload Behavior**: Advanced users can control when tabs get reloaded
- **Legacy Mode Option**: Advanced users can enable `forceLegacyTabReload` in storage for original behavior if needed

### 🔧 Technical Details

- **Adding Sites**: Automatically reloads only the newly added site so headers update immediately
- **Removing Sites**: No reload needed - sites continue normally without spoofing
- **Linux Platform Toggle**: Headers updated immediately, optional reload via `linuxSpoofReloadAllTabs` setting
- **UA String Changes**: Smart reload only when User-Agent actually changes (version updates)
- **Fallback Behavior**: Maintains legacy reload functionality for critical scenarios
- **Enhanced Logging**: Better debugging information for reload decisions

### 🎯 Benefits

- **Instant Effect**: Toggling a site on immediately applies spoofing (no manual refresh needed)
- **No More Disruption**: Other sites remain untouched when toggling unrelated sites
- **Faster Operations**: Only affected sites reload, others continue uninterrupted
- **Same Functionality**: All spoofing capabilities remain fully intact

### 🔄 Behavior Comparison

| Action                | Old Behavior            | New Behavior                             |
| --------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Enable site A         | Reload ALL masked sites | Reload only site A                       |
| Disable site A        | Reload ALL masked sites | No reload (graceful)                     |
| Linux spoof toggle    | Reload ALL sites        | No reload (headers update immediately)\* |
| Chrome version update | Always reload           | Reload only if UA changed                |

\*_Set `linuxSpoofReloadAllTabs: true` in storage for immediate reload if needed_
